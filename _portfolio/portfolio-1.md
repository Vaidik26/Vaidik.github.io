### 🥛 Milk Quality Classification

> **End-to-End ML Pipeline** to classify milk quality (**Low**, **Medium**, **High**) from physicochemical properties like pH, temperature, taste, and fat content.

**🔹 Key Features**
- 📊 **GradientBoostingClassifier** for high-accuracy predictions  
- 🧹 Robust **data preprocessing** & **feature engineering**  
- 🐳 **Docker** for containerized deployment  
- 📦 **DVC** for dataset & model version control  
- ⚡ Scalable & reproducible design for real-world use  

**🛠 Tech Stack:** Python, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Docker, DVC
